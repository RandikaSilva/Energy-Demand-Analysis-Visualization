# Energy Demand Analysis & Visualization - New Zealand ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿

This project provides a comprehensive analysis and forecasting of New Zealandâ€™s energy consumption, carbon emissions, and renewable energy share using **Adaptive Business Intelligence (ABI)** techniques. It integrates **ARIMA/SARIMA** time series models, **Power BI dashboards**, and a **Flask API** to deliver insights and real-time energy forecasting tools.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

New Zealand aims to achieve **net zero carbon emissions by 2050**. This project supports that goal by:
- Forecasting carbon emissions and primary energy consumption
- Evaluating demand vs. generation efficiency
- Visualizing renewable energy share trends

The solution is built using:
- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- ARIMA/SARIMA time series models
- Power BI for dashboards
- Flask for API integration

## ðŸ“ˆ Power BI Dashboards

Interactive dashboards were built to display:
- Historical and forecasted carbon emissions
- Renewable energy contributions over time
- Demand vs. generation efficiency analysis

Power BI is connected to the backend via **Flask API** for dynamic updates.
